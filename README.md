# Unity Tower Defense Project (unfinished)
In the late summer and early fall of 2021 I tried implementing an idea I had for a grid-based tower defense game. My original concept was that you could place towers anywhere on the grid and enemies would adjust their path the more towers you built, and towers would be given to the player after defeating enemies. I soon realized that this project would take lots of time so I had to halt development while school was getting more busy in the fall. Currently the game is unfinished but has a map generator that can make custom and random maps, an enemy pathfinding algorithm, enemy tracking for towers, and templates allowing for a wide variety of towers and enemies, and many more things of lesser note.
